# Screenshots

Visual evidence for these detections. Full unredacted captures are staged in `_raw/` (git-ignored); the cropped copies here (browser chrome removed) are the ones referenced by the docs.

## Redaction

The top crop removes the browser URL bar (which carried the tenant ID). The portal captures
(`02`, `05`, `07`, `08`, `09`, `10`, `11`) additionally have the top-right account chip blacked out,
which carried the UPN, the organization name, and the profile photo. On `10` the incident-link field
(which carried the subscription id) is also blacked out. No subscription IDs are visible in any frame.

Still review before publishing:

- [ ] **Caller email** `ievgen@<redacted-tenant>` in the older alert-detail shots (`06-inc-03`, `06-inc-04`) Query-results "Caller" column; blur if you prefer it not surfaced.

## Optional / not in v1

Per-rule logic shots (`03-rule-0N`), per-incident shots for DET-001/02/05 (`06-inc-01/02/05`), attack-story/timeline (`07`, `08`), and the investigation pivot (`09`) were not captured, the consolidated alert queue (`05`) and the two detail shots cover the story. Add them later if desired.

For the posture-remediation phase ([docs/10](../docs/10-posture-remediation.md)), the Defender for
Cloud Secure Score and its recommendation breakdown are kept as a diffable JSON snapshot
([posture/snapshots](../posture/snapshots)) rather than a screenshot, so no image is required for the
numbers. Optional additive captures if a visual is wanted: `12-defender-cloud-score.png` (the 68.81%
posture score), `13-recommendations.png` (the recommendation list), and an after-remediation
re-score once the tenant recalculates. Same redaction (URL bar cropped, account chip blacked out).
