# Posture remediation: a measured Secure Score loop tied back to the detections

The catalog detects, investigates, and responds. This is the other half of the job: reading the
tenant's own posture score, fixing what it flags, and proving the number moved. It is the same
discipline as the [tuning case study](09-tuning-case-study.md), applied to posture instead of a
single rule: baseline, prioritize, remediate, then **measure** rather than assert.

## The loop

```
baseline -> prioritize -> remediate -> measure (re-score) -> track the rest
```

## Two scores, kept apart

There are two Secure Scores in this tenant and they measure different planes. Conflating them is the
usual mistake.

| Score | Plane | Current value | Source |
|-------|-------|---------------|--------|
| Microsoft 365 Secure Score | identity, apps, data, device | **50.14%**, 94 actions to review | Defender portal ([screenshot](../screenshots/12-secure-score-current.png)) |
| Defender for Cloud Secure Score | Azure resource posture | **68.81%** (21.33 / 31) | ARM `Microsoft.Security`, pulled by [collect-posture.ps1](../posture/collect-posture.ps1) |
| Exposure score | device / vulnerability exposure | **65 / 100**, Medium, trending | Exposure Management ([screenshot](../screenshots/14-exposure-recommendations.png)) |

The Defender for Cloud score is the one driven here because it is the Azure-resource plane these
detections live on, and it is pullable as a [machine-readable snapshot](../posture/snapshots) so the
before/after is a file diff, not a screenshot comparison. The M365 score and the exposure score are
captured from the portal because their APIs (Graph `security/secureScores`, exposure management) need
a consented app the az CLI token does not carry; that limitation is recorded rather than hidden. The
M365 actions-to-review climbed from 32 to 94 as the tenant accumulated data, which is what dropped the
percentage even though nothing regressed: more applicable controls means a larger denominator.

## Baseline (before)

Pulled with `collect-posture.ps1` into [`posture/snapshots/2026-06-10-baseline.json`](../posture/snapshots/2026-06-10-baseline.json).
The score is one number; the useful part is the per-control breakdown, which says exactly where the
9.67 missing points sit. Every scored point that is not yet earned is in four controls:

| Control | Earned / available | Unhealthy resources | Points on the table |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Enable encryption at rest | 0 / 4 | 1 | **4.00** |
| Manage access and permissions | 1.33 / 4 | 2 | 2.67 |
| Restrict unauthorized network access | 2 / 4 | 1 | 2.00 |
| Enable auditing and logging | 0 / 1 | 2 | 1.00 |
| Enable enhanced security features | 0 / 0 | 1 | 0 (plan upgrade, no score weight) |
| Implement security best practices | 0 / 0 | 2 | 0 (no score weight) |

Already at 100%: secure management ports, encrypt data in transit, apply system updates. Closing the
four point-bearing controls is the entire path from 68.81% to 100%. Across the subscription this is
18 unhealthy assessments behind those controls.

## Prioritize

Ranked by blast radius first, then score value. A posture fix that breaks the environment is not a win,
so the order runs from additive-and-reversible to higher-effort, and the licensing-gated items are
called out as accepted risk rather than pretended into the backlog as quick wins.

## Remediate: execution order

1. **Security contact + high-severity alert notifications.** Additive, reversible, no score weight
   but it closes three open recommendations and is the correct first move. Ready to run:
   [`remediate-quickwins.ps1`](../posture/remediate-quickwins.ps1) (dry-run by default, `-Apply` to
   execute).
2. **Diagnostic logs on the SOAR Logic Apps.** Turns on logging for the repo's own
   [mass-deletion-response](../playbooks/mass-deletion-response) and
   [copilot-triage](../playbooks/copilot-triage) playbooks, routed to `sc200-ws`. Additive, and it
   earns the "Enable auditing and logging" point (+1). Logging is also the precondition for the
   detections themselves, so this one closes a posture gap and protects the telemetry in the same
   action.
3. **Encryption at host on the sensor VM.** Earns "Enable encryption at rest" (+4), the single
   biggest item. Requires deallocating `soc-sensor-01`, setting `securityProfile.encryptionAtHost`,
   and starting it back up, so it runs in a short maintenance window.
4. **Storage hardening: restrict network access, disable shared-key.** Earns "Restrict unauthorized
   network access" (+2). The only storage account here is the Defender for Endpoint managed sensor
   store, so flipping shared-key or network rules risks the sensor upload path; held as backlog with
   that reason rather than flipped blind.
5. **Access and permissions: a break-glass second owner, review excess role holders.** Earns "Manage
   access and permissions" (+2.67). Needs a second principal, so it is backlog.

### Applied this session, verified at the resource level

| Fix | Action | Verified | Control |
|-----|--------|----------|---------|
| Security contact + alert notifications | `securityContacts/default` set, alert + owner notify On | contact state `On` | Enhanced features (0 wt) |
| Diagnostic logs on both playbooks | `diag-to-sentinel` setting to `sc200-ws`, WorkflowRuntime logs on | both `logsEnabled: true` | Auditing and logging (+1) |
| Encryption at host on `soc-sensor-01` | deallocate, set `encryptionAtHost=true`, start | `encryptionAtHost: True`, power `VM running` | Encryption at rest (+4) |

These are confirmed at the resource level. Defender for Cloud re-evaluates the matching assessments
on its own scan cycle (hours), and the Secure Score recalculates after that (24 to 72 hours), so the
Unhealthy-to-Healthy flip and the score delta land on the after snapshot, not instantly. Items 4 and
5 stay in the backlog below for the reasons given.

## Closing the loop back to the detections

This is posture work owned by a detection engineer, so each item is mapped to the rule that catches
its regression. Hardening removes the exposure; the detection tells you when it comes back.

| Remediation | Removes | Regression caught by |
|-------------|---------|----------------------|
| Diagnostic logs + auditing | blind spots in the control-plane log | the whole catalog reads `AzureActivity`; losing it blinds [DET-001](../detections/DET-001-failed-activity-log-spike.md) through DET-009 |
| Storage network restriction / no shared-key | public reachability of a resource | [DET-002](../detections/DET-002-nsg-rule-modified.md), [DET-009](../detections/DET-009-nsg-opened-inbound-any.md) (network-exposure change class) |
| Break-glass owner / least privilege | privilege sprawl | [DET-003](../detections/DET-003-rbac-role-assignment-changes.md), [DET-007](../detections/DET-007-rbac-grant-then-deploy.md) |
| Encryption at host | data-at-rest exposure | posture-only, no runtime rule, tracked as a coverage gap |
| Defender for servers (backlog) | endpoint detection coverage | [DET-006](../detections/DET-006-lsass-credential-access.md) depends on the Defender for Endpoint signal |
| Defender for Resource Manager (backlog) | control-plane threat detection | complements DET-001 / DET-003 / DET-005 / DET-007 |

## The rest: tracked backlog

Carried forward, prioritized, not silently dropped:

- **Licensing-gated (accepted risk for a single-operator environment):** enable Defender for Servers, for
  Storage, for Resource Manager, and CSPM. These move the score and add real detection coverage but
  carry per-resource cost; only Discovery and FoundationalCspm run on Standard today. Documented as
  accepted risk with the cost rationale, the same call the posture audit tooling makes.
- **Blast-radius held:** the storage account is the Defender for Endpoint managed sensor store, so
  shared-key and VNet-rule hardening wait until the sensor upload path is confirmed independent of
  them, rather than being flipped on the one storage account the endpoint plane depends on.
- **Effort-gated:** storage private link, Azure Backup, guest configuration / attestation extensions,
  and the break-glass second owner.

## Measure (after): pending re-score

Secure Score recalculates 24 to 72 hours after a change, so the after number is gathered in a
follow-up pass, not claimed here. When it lands:

```powershell
.\collect-posture.ps1 -Label after   # writes posture/snapshots/<date>-after.json
```

The delta table (before vs after per control) and the after screenshot get filled from that snapshot.
No improvement is asserted until the file exists.

## Lesson

A posture score is only credible the same way a detection is: not when you claim it, but when you can
show the measured before and after. Keeping the baseline in a diffable JSON, ordering the fixes by
blast radius, and mapping each one to the rule that catches its regression is what makes this
detection engineering rather than a screenshot of a number.
