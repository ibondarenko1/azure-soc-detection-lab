# Azure SOC Detection Lab

Detection-engineering portfolio built on a **live Microsoft Sentinel + Defender XDR** tenant. Five custom analytics rules watch Azure control-plane activity, each mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, each proven end-to-end: a benign simulated action triggers the rule, the rule raises an incident, and the incident is investigated and documented.

> Built while earning **Microsoft Certified: Security Operations Analyst Associate (SC-200)**. Workspace: `sc200-ws`. All evidence is from a personal lab tenant; tenant/subscription identifiers and any PII are redacted in screenshots.

## Why this exists

A detection is only credible once you can show it firing. This repo closes that loop for five Azure-focused detections: **rule logic → simulated trigger → generated incident → investigation → MITRE mapping.** It is the hands-on companion to SC-200 — Sentinel analytics rules, KQL, and incident response against real telemetry rather than synthetic samples.

## Detection-as-Code

The rules are not clicked into the portal — they are **versioned YAML deployed by a PR-gated pipeline**. Editing a detection means opening a pull request; CI validates it, a reviewer approves, merge to `main` deploys it to Sentinel via **OIDC (no stored secrets)**, idempotently by rule GUID (API `2025-09-01`).

A real change went through it: [PR #1](https://github.com/ibondarenko1/azure-soc-detection-lab/pull/1) tightened the SC200-01 threshold (10 → 8); CI validated it, merge deployed it to the live `sc200-ws` rule. That step — *rules deploy automatically from git by reviewed PR* — is what separates a detection **engineer** from an analyst who finished a course.

## Results

Each detection was triggered with a benign, self-reverted administrative action and produced a real incident:

![Incidents queue](screenshots/05-incidents-queue-populated.png)

Two incidents are written up as full investigations:
- [INV-01 — Mass resource deletion (High)](investigations/INV-01-mass-resource-deletion.md)
- [INV-02 — RBAC privilege escalation](investigations/INV-02-rbac-privilege-escalation.md)
